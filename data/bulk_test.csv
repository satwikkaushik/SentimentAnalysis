The Instructor is very energetic seeing his energy to teach i get more motivated to learn man, His examples are very good , This will be my first ever course on udemy where i will learn something and will complete the course 100% ,I have not completed any course 100% .,5
Awful course! Code that is written in many projects doesnt follow best practices, many examples are poor explained.",1
An amazing course that combines the instructor's knowledge and experience with stories and examples to make learning easier. I personally have prior programming experience, so I can't speak much about the course's approachability for absolute beginners, though I still understood the concepts well enough.The course includes small challenges and guides that help learners with all the modules besides the codes themselves. Mr. Denis also brings his personality into an otherwise technical course, giving variety and a level of intimacy throughout the course. My only criticism would be to either separate the older modules, because it kind of betrays the title by having them be fore Android 12 at most. The instructor's method of teaching and the type of activities have also visibly changed and developed through the years, so after some modules, the difference is noticeable. Overall, the course is great for programmers with a little bit of coding experience and knowledge, because I cannot speak currently for absolute newbies. The instructor brings his own charm and personality to the lessons, even the older ones, as well as his great experience with the topic. Besides my minor criticism, I still greatly recommend this course to anyone looking to learn Kotlin programming in Android.,5
Nice course for beginners to intermediates.,5
so far 25% of this course I completed and it was just a little hard to understand but I think it is good. I have learnt a lot. I will change this comment and update it when I reach 50% of this course. note: I didn't know even one single peace of code before.,5
teach fragments and the navigation graph because no other teacher has taught it and, it would be a great help to students like me who want to learn more in this Android app development field. I think you will do it in a few days and give an update to this course,4
Okay course to learn Android development, especially Jetpack Compose, but there are a couple of issues. Firstly, it is not expected that you have any experience in programming, which makes it a bit frustrating to follow if you are experienced. And I don't think it's enough beginner-friendly. It would be better to just expect you understand the basics of coding and purely focus on teaching Android development. Secondly, only roughly half of the material uses Jetpack Compose, the rest of the projects are done with the ""old"" XML way. I guess the course has been updated but all of the old videos are still there, which can be a good thing if you want to learn XML too but I'd like to do more projects with Compose.,3
The beginning was great, it started slowly as a beginner would understand, but going on, the code was getting more mysterious and fast. And in the end he just uploaded his old videos using XML which in the start he mentioned not to use. So it just looks like he missed huge part of work and just made it to look like there is a lot of info. I would recommend to remake old videos and take it slowly with a new info as we are not pros :),2
only the begining was at a good pace after basics he just didnt explained anything on how things are happening and why we are creating an object it was just copy paste after that it was more like he was creating an app and not explaining anything .. dont take this course if u r a begineer,1
What's going on ! if you have started teaching android using jetpack Compose then at least build a big project in it . This is very disappointing that later on in this course from Lecture 20 you are using the old XML technique to form Apps .,2
